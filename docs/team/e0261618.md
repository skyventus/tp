## Project: NUS Expenses Tracker (NET)
NET is an app for managing expenses, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

### Contributions to the project.

* New Feature: Added the ability to delete expenses.
([#13](https://github.com/AY2021S1-TIC4001-4/tp/pull/13)).
  * What it does: Allows the user to delete transaction one at a time. 
  * Justification: This feature is considered as the core features of the product as a user can make mistakes in their commands and the app should provide a convenient way for them to remove them.
  * Credits: Logic and design adapted from addressbook-level2 ([Url](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level2/blob/master/src/seedu/addressbook/ui/TextUi.java))
  
* New Feature: Added the ability to generate a summary report based on a specific time period.
([#40](https://github.com/AY2021S1-TIC4001-4/tp/pull/40)).
  * What it does: Allows the user to generate a list of expenses summary and export it into excel format with basic information such as Date, Usage, Category, Amount, Report Generated Date-Time, Report Generated Period Date-Time. 
  * Justification: This feature is the highlight of the product as a user does not only get to add daily expenses/budget into the system, but also to generate a summary report for them to view and better manage their expenses.
  * Credits: This function uses Java API to access Microsoft Excel format files.

* Community:
  * Our application was created using a combination of pair-programming and adhoc coding sessions. During each session lasting between an hour to four or more, all group members sat in a meeting session while coding/ implementing their assigned components. If a concern was raised or support was needed, they shared their screen via the meeting session and everyone participated or assisted to clear the obstacle. Using this method we've successfully cleared v1.0 to v3.0 of our project milestones. 

* Tools
  * Integrated a third-party library (Apache POI) to the report function.
