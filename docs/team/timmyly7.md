## Project: NUS Expenses Tracker (NET)
NET is an app for managing expenses, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

### Contributions to the project.

* Initial Parser Util for all commands([#11](https://github.com/AY2021S1-TIC4001-4/tp/pull/11))

* New Feature: Added the ability to add expenses in the system([#12](https://github.com/AY2021S1-TIC4001-4/tp/pull/12), [#36](https://github.com/AY2021S1-TIC4001-4/tp/pull/36)) 
  * What it does: Allows the user to add daily expenses one at a time. User can specify information such as description, data, amount and category. 
  * Justification: This feature is considered as one of the core features of the product as a user will need to add an expense in their commands in order to manage them and the app should provide a convenient way for them to do so.
  * Credits: Logic and design adapted from addressbook-level2 ([AddCommand](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level2/tree/master/src/seedu/addressbook/command))

* Community:
  * Our application was created using a combination of pair-programming and adhoc coding sessions. During each session lasting between an hour to four or more, all group members sat in a meeting session while coding/ implementing their assigned components. If a concern was raised or support was needed, they shared their screen via the meeting session and everyone participated or assisted to clear the obstacle. Using this method we've successfully cleared v1.0 to v3.0 of our project milestones.
